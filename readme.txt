Direct Admin Reseller Connection let's your users manage their Direct Admin account with their Wordpress website profile and login.

== Description ==

Direct Admin Reseller Connection let's your users manage their Direct Admin account with their Wordpress website profile and login. At this moment you can show them their stats in a widget (if logged in and DA account in their profile) and/or your own reseller stats in a Dashboard Widget. Users can also manage all their email address settings and domainpointers from a desired page by adding a shortcode. Updates coming soon!

I'm doing my best to make it safe, but using it is at your own risk ofcourse!
